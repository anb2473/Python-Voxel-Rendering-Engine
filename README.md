# Voxel Rendering Engine

This is a fully equiped voxel rendering engine for python. It includes a simple and clean interface to adding voxels to scenes. Currently the `main.py` file is designed to simply generate a test scene with voxel geometry and `main2.py` simply generates a scene testing all color options, however in order to change this you can simply edit where and how the voxels are rendered. And you can also include options to draw different colored blocls with the ID tag.

**Also,** the math for this engine is applicable for any application, so please feel free to adopt the math for your own projects.
