# Voxel Rendering Engine

This is a fully equiped voxel rendering engine for python. It includes a simple and clean interface to adding voxels to scenes. Currently the `main.py` file is designed to simply generate a test scene, however in order to change this you can simply edit where and how the voxels are rendered. And you can also include options to draw different colored blocls with the ID tag.
